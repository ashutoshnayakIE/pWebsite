We (along with Dr. Asif Iquebal Sikandar and Prof Manoj Kumar Tiwari) taught a part of naval operations analysis course to Indian Navy officers in July 2014 in IIT Delhi as part of delegates from IIT Kharagpur. The program was designed for navy officers who, after taking the course will go back and train new recruits to Indian Navy. The course we taught included the topics discussed below. We covered the topics using a graphic user interface (GUI) designed for "learning by doing". The officers could change the parameters of the algorithms to visually see the change in results to understand the effect of each of the parameters. The courses I taught were:

<ul>
<li><b>Game Theory</b>.<br> The GUI would generate random payoffs and show the nash equillibrium based on the payoffs once they click on result tab It further explained the calculations. GUI was aimed to provide an introduction to Game Theory. .</li>
<li><b>Resource Allocation using Genetic Algorithm</b>.<br> After a high level explanation of how Genetic Algorithms work, GUI on genetic algorithm was used by the officers to understand the effect of changing each of the parameters. We used the optimization problem of allocation of weapons for optimal deployment of resources.</li>
<li><b>Computer Aided Search (CAS)</b>.<br> CAS is a probabilistic algorithm that updates the probability of finding an enemy in ocean based on different inputs. It updates the probability dynamically as more information is fed into the software. The GUI explained visually how the probabilities change based on inputs. The software is designed to be used for allocation of resources (ships) for countering the attack.</li>
</ul>

## Learn

The general form of the **normal** probability density function is:

$$
f(x) = \frac{1}{\sigma \sqrt{2\pi} } e^{-\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{x-\mu}{\sigma}\right)^2}
$$

{{< callout note >}}
The parameter $\mu$ is the mean or expectation of the distribution.
$\sigma$ is its standard deviation.
The variance of the distribution is $\sigma^{2}$.

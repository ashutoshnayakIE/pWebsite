As part of my research assitantship in Indiana Manufacturing Competitiveness Center (<a href="https://www.purdue.edu/in-mac/" target = "_blank">INMaC</a>), I was responsible for building optimization models for different manufacturing companies to solve problems specific to the manufacturing sites. Apart from building models and a deploying the software, I was also responsible for teaching the software to the stakeholders involved in using the software. The training generally involved two sessions:

<ul>
<li><b>Session 1</b>.<br> The first session was designed for high level employees (site manager to CEOs) and was aimed at discussing the benefits of using the software. It was also used to explain the optimization models used (non-technical explanation) and assumptions of the models. It was also meant to understand the requirements for running and maintaining the software and potential changes that the software may propose (e.g. rescheduling working hours of employees, change in data management system). It was organized before final training sessions to fine tune and align with the deliverables of the project.</li>
<li><b>Session 2</b>.<br> The second session was designed for employees who will actually work with the software. These sessions went into details of the software so that it can be fixed later in case of any issues. Session 2 were more hands on to understand the working of the software.</li>
</ul>

As a masters student in IIT Kharagpur, I (with Mohammad Arshad Naeem) were instructors for labs in the course "Heuristics Lab" by Prof Manoj Kumar Tiwari. We introduced the first course in IIT Kharagpur on CPLEX and SAS. We developed the course, used problems from websites e.g. Kaggle and taught students how to use CPLEX for optimization and SAS for data analytics and machine learning. The specific goals of the labs were to:

<ul>
<li>Introduce optimization solvers and machine learning software for industrial engineering students</li>
<li>Teach programming for optimization so that they can use it in their final Thesis</li>
</ul>

I will be teaching operations research methods in Spring 2022 to UC Davis MSBA students. The course will cover basics of optimization, linear programming and use cases of optimization in Marketing and Finance. The course description will be similar to the one that can be found <a href="https://webapps.aws.ucdavis.edu/public/documents/4228273/Syllabus" target="_blank">here</a>. 

I will update this section as I build the materials for the class.

## Learn

The general form of the **normal** probability density function is:

$$
f(x) = \frac{1}{\sigma \sqrt{2\pi} } e^{-\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{x-\mu}{\sigma}\right)^2}
$$

{{< callout note >}}
The parameter $\mu$ is the mean or expectation of the distribution.
$\sigma$ is its standard deviation.
The variance of the distribution is $\sigma^{2}$.

I write posts on some topics that are not usually covered in classes. In these topics, I try to explain the logic or reasoning for a particular idea of an algorithm or data science ideas in general. These posts are most of the times outcome when I do not understand "why", so I read upon it and try to explain it in an (hopefully) easy way. I post them and blogs in Medium. I write for "Towards Data Science" group. 

<ul>
<li>How XGBoost trees are constructed and are they different from random forest trees (or bagging/boosting).</li>
<li>What is the core idea behind LIME and SHAP used to explain predictions of machine learning algorithms.</li>
<li>Marketing researchers deal a lot with Endogeneity. But what is it and why every data scientist should know about it></li>
<li>Akaike Information Criteria us used to "select" model. But how does it do that?</li>
<li>How cross entropy in machine learning is linked to information theory?</li>
</ul>


The details of the topics can be found <a href = "https://github.com/ashutoshnayakIE/Data-Science-Tutorials" target = "_blank">here</a>.

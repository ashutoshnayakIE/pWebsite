I conducts workshops for University of California, Davis students enrolled in Masters of Science in Business Analytics (MSBA) program. First 3 workshops cover the basics of programming in python (starting from reading files to object oriented programming). One of the sessions cover introduction to github as version control system. The workshop also covers how to code a machine learning algorithm in R and solve the same in python to ensure students with either background could follow the classes based on other languages. Some of the python notebooks from the workshops:

{{< spoiler text="What is the difference between lists and tuples?" >}}
Lists

- Lists are mutable - they can be changed
- Slower than tuples
- Syntax: `a_list = [1, 2.0, 'Hello world']`

Tuples

- Tuples are immutable - they can't be changed
- Tuples are faster than lists 
- Syntax: `a_tuple = (1, 2.0, 'Hello world')`

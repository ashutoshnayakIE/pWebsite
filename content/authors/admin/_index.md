Hi, I am currently working in Graduate School of Management at University of California, Davis as a Postdoctoral Scholar. I work in the field of understanding consumer behavior and use it for consumer relationship management. I specifically work on using consumer journey with a firm and observe how consumer behavior changes over time. Understanding consumer behavior can help in answering questions that firms may want to know for improved consumer satisfaction and increasing their sales. Some of the questions include:

1. How do consumers respond to campaigns or firm initiated interventions? <br>
2. What makes a consumer uninstall the app? <br>
3. How do new innovations (e.g. vernacular, voice feature) affect consumer behavior?<br>
4. Sending Campaigns? Which consumer to target and how to target.

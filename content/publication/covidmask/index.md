abstract: We examine the association of reported mask-wearing in a population within a country with the growth rate of active cases COVID-19 cases. The analysis uses country-wide data from weekly surveys of individuals’ mask-wearing behavior in public places, as well as other concurrently implemented non-pharmaceutical interventions, mobility changes, new cases of COVID-19 data and other control variables. The mask-wearing data were obtained from the Imperial College — YouGov multi-country survey of people’s personal habits before and during COVID-19. Because mask-wearing showed substantial variation across countries and over time, we use a reduced form econometric model to relate population-wide changes in mask-wearing to the growth rate in COVID-19.
